# About

I'm a software engineer with deep roots in embedded systems, currently at Electrolux building Flutter frontends and Rust backends on Linux. My journey from five years of embedded development to modern application architecture brings a unique perspective on performance and reliability.

## Beyond Code


- **Photography** - Street and nature photography, capturing spontaneous moments and patient observations.

- **Making** - 3D printing, electronics projects, and building things from concept to reality.

- **Hi-fi Audio** - Building speakers, understanding acoustics, and enjoying vinyl and CDs on my setups.



## Technical Stack


- **Current**: Flutter, Rust, Linux
- **Background**: 5+ years embedded C/C++
- **Making**: 3D printing, electronics, speaker design

## Philosophy

Coming from embedded development, I believe in efficient, reliable software whether working with 32KB of flash or distributed systems. Photography teaches patience, making teaches problem-solving, and both remind me that good engineering considers the entire system, not just the code.
