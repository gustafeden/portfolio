### Vibe Coded Portfolio
*Personal Project | 2025*

Experimenting with the vibe coding trend to craft a portfolio that feels more like film photography than a tech resume. A work in progress that evolves by feel, not roadmap.

**The Vibe:**
- Analog film aesthetics meet modern web
- Colors pulled from tungsten lights and film burns
- Navigation that physically moves aside
- Still evolving daily

**Tech Stack:** Vanilla JS, Tailwind CSS, Custom Markdown Parser, Anime.js
