# Data Visualization Dashboard

*Data Visualization Engineer | 2024*

Created an interactive dashboard for real-time business analytics, featuring custom data visualizations, predictive analytics, and automated reporting.

## Project Background

The client was drowning in data but struggling to extract actionable insights. They had multiple data sources generating terabytes of information daily, but executives were still making decisions based on week-old static reports. We needed to create a real-time view into their business that could surface insights automatically.

### The Challenge
- **Data silos** - Information scattered across 15+ different systems
- **Delayed insights** - Reports were 5-7 days behind real-time
- **Analysis paralysis** - Too much data, not enough context
- **Manual processes** - Analysts spending 80% of time on data prep
- **Scaling issues** - Existing tools couldn't handle data volume

## Technical Architecture

### Data Pipeline Architecture
```
Data Sources → Kafka → Processing Layer → Storage → Visualization

- ERP System    Processing   Spark        TimescaleDB  Custom
- Web Analytics  ↓          Python ML     Redis Cache  Components  
- IoT Sensors   Real-time   Predictive    S3 Archive
- API Feeds     Events      Models
```
