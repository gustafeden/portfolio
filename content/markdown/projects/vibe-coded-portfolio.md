# Vibe Coding This Portfolio

*Personal Project | 2025*

Experimenting with the vibe coding trend to craft a portfolio that feels more like film photography than a tech resume.

## Project Overview

Everyone's talking about vibe coding – that loose, intuitive approach where you code by feel rather than rigid specs. I wanted to see if I could push beyond the generic "dark mode with neon accents" aesthetic that floods every vibe-coded project. This portfolio became my testing ground.

## The Vibe I Was After

Instead of the typical tech-bro minimalism, I pulled inspiration from:
- **Analog film photography** – those warm tungsten lights and accidental light leaks
- **Hi-fi audio equipment** – clean but warm, technical but inviting
- **Old architecture photos** – where the building becomes the UI

The color palette came from staring at old film stocks: Shadow Black darker than the photos so they float, Amber Glow like tungsten bulbs, Film Burn Rose from those happy accidents on expired film.

## Technical Choices by Feel

- **No framework** – Just vanilla JS because it felt right to hand-craft it
- **Markdown for content** – Write naturally, let the code handle the rest
- **Background opacity shifts** – Full presence on landing, then fades to memory

## What's Different

Most vibe-coded sites feel like they're trying too hard to be "vibey." I wanted this to feel like it emerged naturally – like developing a photo in a darkroom where you're adjusting by instinct, not measuring.

The navigation doesn't just highlight; it physically moves other items out of the way. The profile photo floats slightly, breathing with the page. These aren't features from a requirements doc – they're what felt right in the moment.

## Still Evolving

This is very much a work in progress. Some days I change the entire color palette. Other days I rewrite how content loads. That's the point – it's alive, shifting with my mood and what I'm learning.

Vibe coding isn't about being imprecise; it's about letting intuition guide precision. This portfolio is my ongoing experiment in that balance.
