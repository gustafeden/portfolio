# Mobile Banking App

*Lead Designer | 2023*

Designed and developed a mobile-first banking application focusing on security and user experience. Implemented biometric authentication and real-time transaction monitoring.

## Design Philosophy

Traditional banking apps often feel intimidating and complex. Our goal was to create something that felt approachable while maintaining the security and trustworthiness users expect from financial services. We focused on clear visual hierarchy and intuitive gestures.

> "Make banking feel as simple as texting a friend, but as secure as a vault."

## User Research & Insights

### Research Methods
- **30 in-depth interviews** with millennials aged 25-35  
- **Survey of 500 users** about banking app pain points
- **Competitive analysis** of 12 leading banking apps
- **Usability testing** with 5 rounds of prototypes

### Key Insights
- **Frustration with complex navigation** - Users wanted fewer taps to complete tasks
- **Desire for real-time notifications** - Immediate alerts for all transactions
- **Security anxiety** - Need for visible security indicators
- **Social features** - Ability to split bills and send money to friends
- **Quick access** - Balance checking without full authentication
